# Duplicate Booking Prevention Feature

## Overview
This feature prevents users from creating multiple pre-bookings for the same vehicle, ensuring that each vehicle can only be in one queue at a time.

## How It Works

### 1. Backend Protection

#### New API Endpoint: `/api/available-vehicles`
- **Purpose**: Returns only vehicles that are NOT currently in any queue
- **Filters out**: Vehicles with 'pending' or 'locked' status
- **Returns**: Available electric vehicles for the user

#### Enhanced Pre-booking Creation: `/api/prebook`
- **Duplicate Check**: Before creating a booking, checks if vehicle is already in queue
- **Error Response**: Returns 409 Conflict if vehicle is already booked
- **Status Check**: Looks for 'pending' or 'locked' status

### 2. Frontend Protection

#### PreBookingModal Updates
- **Available Vehicles Only**: Dropdown shows only vehicles not in queue
- **Real-time Updates**: Refreshes available vehicles after successful booking
- **Error Handling**: Shows clear error messages for duplicate attempts
- **Disabled State**: Book button disabled when no vehicles available

#### MyPreBookings Component Updates
- **Queue Status**: Shows when all vehicles are in queue
- **Helpful Messages**: Explains when vehicles become available again
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear status display for each booking

## Database Queries

### Get Available Vehicles
```sql
-- Get all electric vehicles for user
SELECT vehicleid, registrationnumber, make, fueltype, latitude, longitude
FROM vehicles 
WHERE userid = $1 AND fueltype = 'Electric'

-- Get vehicles already in queue
SELECT DISTINCT vehicleid 
FROM prebookings 
WHERE userid = $1 AND status IN ('pending', 'locked')

-- Filter out queued vehicles
```

### Check for Duplicate Booking
```sql
SELECT id FROM prebookings 
WHERE userid = $1 AND vehicleid = $2 AND status IN ('pending', 'locked')
```

## User Experience

### When Creating a Booking
1. **Open Pre-booking Modal**: Only available vehicles shown
2. **Select Vehicle**: Dropdown filtered to exclude queued vehicles
3. **Submit Booking**: Backend validates no duplicate exists
4. **Success**: Vehicle removed from available list
5. **Error**: Clear message if duplicate attempted

### When All Vehicles Are Queued
- **Blue Info Box**: "All vehicles in queue" message
- **Explanation**: Tells user when vehicles become available
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of current status

### When Vehicle Becomes Available
- **Automatic Refresh**: Available vehicles list updates
- **Status Change**: Booking status changes to 'arrived' or 'expired'
- **Re-enable Booking**: Vehicle appears in dropdown again

## Error Messages

### Duplicate Booking Attempt
```
"This vehicle is already in a pre-booking queue. 
Please wait for the current booking to complete or mark it as arrived."
```

### No Available Vehicles
```
"No electric vehicles available for pre-booking. 
All your vehicles may already be in a queue."
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Confusion**: Users can't accidentally book same vehicle twice
2. **Queue Integrity**: Ensures fair queue management
3. **Clear Feedback**: Users understand why vehicles aren't available
4. **Automatic Updates**: Real-time status changes
5. **Better UX**: Intuitive interface with helpful messages

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes
- New `/api/available-vehicles` endpoint
- Enhanced duplicate checking in `/api/prebook`
- Proper error handling and status codes

### Frontend Changes
- Updated PreBookingModal to use available vehicles API
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Real-time updates and status indicators

### Database Considerations
- Efficient queries with proper indexing
- Status-based filtering
- User-specific vehicle filtering

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Normal Booking**: Vehicle not in queue → Success
2. **Duplicate Attempt**: Vehicle in queue → Error 409
3. **All Vehicles Queued**: No available vehicles → Info message
4. **Vehicle Becomes Available**: Status change → Appears in dropdown
5. **Multiple Users**: Each user sees only their available vehicles

This feature ensures a clean, fair, and user-friendly pre-booking experience while preventing queue manipulation and confusion.
